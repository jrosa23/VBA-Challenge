# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 VBA Challenge
I got stuck with this challenge for a good portion of the weekend and beginning of this week.

I was able to iteratively sift through the rows and collect the stock ticker name as well as the volume totals, but had a very hard time capturing the inital open value for the stock in a given quarter.

The closing value was easy enough to collect, but I did ask the xpert learning assitant to help me with the logic behind the quarterly change in that function of my script, as well as for the percent change 
seeing as they are linked, both of which sections are commented out in the lines of my script denoted with a '----Xpert'.

I also asked the xpert learning assistant to help me figure out the placement of the additional analysis print statements, as I was having weird spacing issues, and inconsistency in printing those values between worksheets.
